        <p>HiðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Tulga (Tulga-Erdene / á ²á ¤á ¯á ­á Žá  -á ¡á ·á ³á ¡á ¨á ¢) Sodjargal. I'm currently a 3rd year student at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), pursuing a major in Bioengineering with a double major in Chemistry and AI Specialized Major. My current dry-lab research interests include biophysical simulations, rational (bio)molecule design, lab automation, and scientific software development.</p>
        <p>On the wet-lab side, I am interested in structural biology and spectroscopy. At the moment, I am in the Reverse Translation Lab (of Prof. Rajib Schubert), researching methods of early cancer detection. I'm also doing a remote internship under Prof. Taras V. Pogorelov on molecular dynamics simulations of membrane molecules. Before that, I did 1 year of undergraduate research in the Sustainable Catalysis Lab (of Prof. Yoonsu Park), where I researched organic reaction development using catalyst optimization, as well as a 4-month Specified Research under Prof. Byung-Ha Oh on physics- and ML-based methods of protein design. I was previously the captain of the national robotics team at FIRST Global 2020, and I native fluency in English and Russian. </p>

        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <p>About a third of my classes have been lab/research or project-based courses, and I have been compiling a list of these projects/reports on top of miscellaneous projects I have been doing since high school. You can find them here.</p>
